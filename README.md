# Losant Python REST API Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-rest-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Losant/losant-rest-python) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/losant-rest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/losant-rest)

The [Losant](https://www.losant.com) REST API client provides a simple way to use the comprehensive Losant API. You can authenticate either as a Losant device or with your user account, and have access to all the functionality of the Losant platform.

This client works with both Python 2.7 and 3. It uses [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/) under the covers for the actual HTTP communication.

<br/>

## Installation

The latest stable version is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi) and can be installed using

```bash
pip install losant-rest
```

<br/>

## Example

Below is a high-level example of using the Losant Python REST API client to authenticate against the Losant Platform and report state for a device.

```python
from losantrest import Client
from analog import AnalogSensor

client = Client()
creds = {
    'deviceId': 'my-device-id',
    'key': 'my-app-access-key',
    'secret': 'my-app-access-secret'
}
response = client.auth.authenticate_device(credentials=creds)

client.auth_token = response['token']
app_id = response['applicationId']

state = {'data': {'temperature': AnalogSensor.read()}}
response = client.device.send_state(deviceId='my-device-id',
    applicationId=app_id, deviceState=state)

print(response)
""" {'success': True} """
```

## API Documentation

### Client

A client is a single api instance. By default, it is unauthenticated, but can be given an access token to perform authenticated requests.

#### Constructor

```python
Client(auth_token=None, url="https://api.losant.com")
```

The ``Client()`` constructor takes the following arguments:

* auth_token  
  The access token to be used for authentication - by default there is no access token. An access token can be acquired through any of the [Auth](docs/auth.md) methods, or can be created for a particular application through [application_api_tokens](docs/applicationApiTokens.md).

* url  
  The url of the Losant API - by default <https://api.losant.com>.

#### Properties

* auth_token  
  The access token can be accessed or changed after Client creation through this property.

* url  
  The api base url can be accessed or changed after Client creation through this property.
